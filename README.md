# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a basic example of what is going on behind the scenes of some of the largest social media apps out there. Utilizing MongoDB within an express framework, I built an API with basic endpoints to allow CRUD operations on two primary types of data, Users and Thoughts. Through this challenge, I have developed my skills in the following technologies:
- MongoDB 
    - Creating and interacting with NoSQL databases.
- Mongoose 
    - Defining and implementing schemas and models of varying complexity. 
- Express 
    - Refined understanding of how to layout and implement routes for an API.
